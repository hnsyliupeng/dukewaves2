%% TRIANGLE_AREA_2D computes the area of a triangle in 2D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    If the triangle's vertices are given in counterclockwise order,
%    the area will be positive.  If the triangle's vertices are given
%    in clockwise order, the area will be negative!
%
%    An earlier version of this routine always returned the absolute
%    value of the computed area.  I am convinced now that that is
%    a less useful result!  For instance, by returning the signed 
%    area of a triangle, it is possible to easily compute the area 
%    of a nonconvex polygon as the sum of the (possibly negative) 
%    areas of triangles formed by node 1 and successive pairs of vertices.
